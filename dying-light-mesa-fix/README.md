# Dying Light Mesa Fix
PKGBUILD for launching Dying Light with a modified OpenGL version string.

## PKGBUILD Status  
- [ ] Tested and complete  
- [x] Untested and incomplete  

**Note:** I can only test this on my R9 Fury, although I assume it will work with any Mesa-compatible card that supports OpenGL >= v4.5. You can check your cards compatibility here https://www.x.org/wiki/RadeonFeature/
