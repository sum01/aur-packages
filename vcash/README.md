# [On the AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/vcash/)
As stated in my main README, I will no longer maintain the PKGBUILD here.

## To-do list  
- [ ] Rework PKGBUILD when [this issue](https://github.com/openvcash/vcash/pull/4) is commited (fix/remove sources to deps, add actual dependencies instead).
- [ ] Fix versions from GCC when [this issue](https://github.com/openvcash/vcash/issues/14) is resolved.
- [ ] Remove db file when above are fixed
