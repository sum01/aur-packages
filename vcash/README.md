# Vcash
PKGBUILD for installing the Vcash cryptocurrency wallet.  

https://github.com/openvcash/vcash  

## PKGBUILD Status  
- [ ] Tested & Functional
- [x] Untested & Non-functional

I am putting this PKGBUILD on hold at the moment, until the GCC issues are fixed, as I'm having a lot of issues getting the dependencies to work correctly with Arch.

### To-do list  
- [ ] Rework PKGBUILD when [this issue](https://github.com/openvcash/vcash/pull/4) is commited (fix/remove sources to deps, add actual dependencies instead).
- [ ] Fix versions from GCC when [this issue](https://github.com/openvcash/vcash/issues/14) is resolved.
