# Tribler
PKGBUILD for installing the Tribler client.  
Note that this is not the PKGBUILD in the AUR, but my improvement of it.

## PKGBUILD Status  
- [x] Tested and Functional

**Note:** An issue unrelated to my PKGBUILD will cause you to potentially not be able to download torrents if you have 1-3 hops enabled -- [Ref](https://forum.tribler.org/t/tribler-7-release-candidate-1-please-test/3988/3)
*   A fix to this issue is to disable all hops, but be careful as you will no longer be anonymous.
