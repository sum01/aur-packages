# Steam OpenGL Compat
PKGBUILD for launching Steam with a modified OpenGL version string.  

I will keep updating to whatever the highest OpenGL version is that works with newer cards.

## PKGBUILD Status  
- [x] Tested and complete  

**Note:** I can only test this on my R9 Fury, although I assume it will work with any Mesa-compatible card that supports the same OpenGL version as Volcanic Islands cards.
