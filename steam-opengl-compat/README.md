# Steam OpenGL Compat
PKGBUILD for launching Steam with a modified OpenGL version string.  

I will keep updating to whatever the highest OpenGL version is that works with newer cards.

## PKGBUILD Status  
- [x] Tested and Functional
- [ ] Non-functional

Some games seem to not work with newer OpenGL versions, so if you are getting a black screen when launching the game, then relaunch `Steam` without using `OpenGL Compat`.

**Note:** I can only test this on my R9 Fury, although it should work with any Mesa-compatible card that meets the dependency version.  

You can check your cards compatibility here https://www.x.org/wiki/RadeonFeature/
